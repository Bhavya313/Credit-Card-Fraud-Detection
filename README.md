# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end **Credit Card Fraud Detection System** built using Machine Learning.  
It addresses the challenge of **highly imbalanced datasets** by applying **SMOTE** and deploys the trained model as a **FastAPI REST API**, fully containerized using **Docker**.

The system predicts whether a credit card transaction is **fraudulent or legitimate** in real time.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Credit card fraud detection is difficult because fraudulent transactions are extremely rare compared to normal transactions.  
Traditional models tend to favor the majority class, resulting in missed fraud cases (false negatives).

---

## ✅ Solution Approach
- Performed data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Handled class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- Trained and evaluated multiple ML models
- Selected **Random Forest** as the best-performing model
- Tuned prediction thresholds to improve fraud recall
- Deployed the model using **FastAPI**
- Containerized the application using **Docker**
